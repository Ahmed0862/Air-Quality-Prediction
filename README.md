# Air-Quality-Prediction
Due to rising industrialization and urbanization, air pollution has become a daunting environmental concern. PM2.5 causes more harm to people than any other airborne impurity combined. Finding the precise amount of PM.5 in the atmosphere is significantly more valuable. We conducted a study focused on the Air Quality Index (AQI), which indicates the level of pollution in the air, to resolve this problem. To categorize the provided data and assess the delicate nature of the air quality reported, we created a machine utilizing the Random Forest Classifier and using a boosting algorithm of AdaBoost to increase the prediction power
